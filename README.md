# [Get Started With Dart Language for Web Apps][published url]
## Instructor: [Ashraff Hathibelagal][instructor url]

The Dart programming language, initially developed by Google, is an easier and cleaner alternative to JavaScript. That's probably why it's one of the fastest growing languages for web app development today. 

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Ashraff Hathibelagal will show you how to build web apps with Dart. In less than an hour, you will learn the basics of the language, as well as advanced features such as object-oriented and asynchronous programming. Furthermore, because most web developers who use Dart tend to use it with the Angular framework, this course also introduces you to Angular Dart 2. 

One of the best things about using Dart is that it is supported by several popular IDEs and code editors. Throughout the course, you will be using IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE for Dart.

## Source Files Description
